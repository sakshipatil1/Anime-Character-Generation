# Anime-Face-Generation

#Problem Statement : 
Anime is becoming increasingly popular in the current world, and people are more interested in learning about it than before. These anime characters are being used in a variety of daily life fields, including education, advertising, etc., to stay current with needs and trends. As more clients began their hunt for a professional artist to create a new face, there was a corresponding increase in the requirement for advanced technology. However, it takes a lot of time and is frequently ineffective. To address this issue and optimize the character generation process, the proposed system will use a Deep Learning solution known as StyleGAN. This system guarantees to save the company’s time in finding a professional artist and creating a new anime face. 

#Solution Approach : 
The project's goal is to create anime faces from information that is provided in image format. As a result, the collection is made up of raw data—images—that have been collected in various formats. We begin by gathering a significant amount of data, preprocessing it, and then transforming it to the necessary format for the feature extraction stage that follows. The most crucial and challenging aspect of the endeavor is feature extraction. The model training method makes use of the retrieved characteristics. After the model is constructed, we assess its correctness and put it to the test using different weights.

#Algorithms Used :
• EDA 
• Preprocessing
• StyleGAN (Discriminator|Loss function|Generator)
